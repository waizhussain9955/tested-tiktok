                                <p>TikTok doesn’t offer an official in-app no-watermark download, so you use a third-party downloader: copy link → paste → choose no watermark (if available).</p>

                                <p>Many guides note TikTok may not support true 4K and can downscale to 1080p, so “4K/8K” results depend on platform limits.</p>

                                <p>No. Videos are generally copyrighted by creators, and TikTok’s terms/policies apply. Download for personal use is safer; get permission for reuse.</p>
